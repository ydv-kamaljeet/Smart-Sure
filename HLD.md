# SmartSure — High Level Design (HLD)

## 1. System Overview

SmartSure is a microservices-based insurance management platform. It allows users to buy vehicle and home insurance policies, file and track claims, and enables admins to manage users, policies, claims, and generate reports.

---

## 2. Architecture Style

**Microservices + Event-Driven Architecture**

- Each domain (Identity, Policy, Claims, Admin) is an independent service with its own database
- Services communicate asynchronously via RabbitMQ using the publish/subscribe pattern
- A single API Gateway (Ocelot) is the entry point for all client requests
- No direct service-to-service HTTP calls — all cross-service data sync happens through events

---

### 4.4 Admin Service (Port 5113)
Read-side aggregator for the admin portal. Maintains mirrored data from all other services.

**Responsibilities:**
- Admin dashboard KPIs (total claims, policies, revenue, active users)
- Policy management (view all, cancel)

- Route-based forwarding to downstream services
- Rate limiting (configurable per route)
- No authentication — JWT validation is done by each downstream service

**Route Mapping:**

| Upstream Path | Downstream Service |
|---|---|
| `/api/auth/**` | Identity API :5001 |
| `/api/policy/**` | Policy API :5152 |
| `/api/dashboard` | Policy API :5152 |
| `/api/claims/**` | Claims API :5008 |
| `/api/admin/**` | Admin API :5113 |

## 5. Event Flow Diagrams

### 5.1 User Registration
```
User registers → Identity API
  → saves to IdentityDB
  → publishes UserRegisteredEvent
      → Admin Service: mirrors user into AdminUsers
      → Policy Service: stores user as PolicyHolder
  → sends verification email (Gmail SMTP)
```

### 5.2 Buy Policy
```
User buys policy → Policy API
  → calculates IDV and premium
  → saves to PolicyDB
  → publishes PolicyCreatedEvent
      → Admin Service: mirrors into AdminPolicies
      → Claims Service: mirrors into ValidPolicies
```

### 5.3 File a Claim
```
User files claim → Claims API
  → validates policy exists in ValidPolicies
  → validates policy is not Cancelled
  → validates claim amount ≤ IDV
  → saves claim to ClaimsDB
  → publishes ClaimSubmittedEvent
      → Admin Service: mirrors into AdminClaims
```

### 5.4 Admin Approves/Rejects Claim
```
Admin approves/rejects → Admin API
  → updates AdminClaim status
  → publishes ClaimApprovedEvent / ClaimRejectedEvent
      → Admin Service (self): sends email to user
      → Claims Service: updates Claim status
```

### 5.5 Admin Cancels Policy
```
Admin cancels → Policy API (PUT /api/policy/policies/{id}/cancel)
  → updates Policy status to Cancelled in PolicyDB
  → publishes PolicyCancelledEvent
      → Admin Service: updates AdminPolicy status + sends email to user
      → Claims Service: updates ValidPolicy status to Cancelled
```

## 6. Security Design

| Concern | Approach |
|---|---|
| Authentication | JWT with RSA-256 (asymmetric keys) |
| Key storage | RSA keys in `.env` file, never committed to source control |
| Authorization | Role-based (`User`, `Admin`) enforced per endpoint |
| Token invalidation | In-memory blacklist on logout |
| CORS | Restricted to `http://localhost:4200` |
| Secrets | All credentials in `.env`, empty strings in `appsettings.json` |

---

## 7. Database Design (Per Service)

Each service owns its database — no shared DB, no cross-DB joins in application code.

```
SmartSure_IdentityDB    → Users, Roles, OtpCodes
SmartSure_PolicyDB      → Policies, InsuranceTypes, InsuranceSubTypes,
                          VehicleDetails, HomeDetails, Payments
SmartSure_ClaimsDB      → Claims, ClaimHistory, ClaimDocuments, ValidPolicies
SmartSure_AdminDB       → AdminUsers, AdminPolicies, AdminClaims,
                          AuditLogs, Reports
```

Cross-service data consistency is maintained through **event-driven mirroring** — each service keeps a local copy of the data it needs from other services, updated via RabbitMQ consumers.

## 9. IDV Calculation Logic

IDV (Insured Declared Value) is calculated on the frontend at policy purchase time and back-calculated from the stored premium when displaying.

**Vehicle IDV:**
```
Age = Current Year - Manufacturing Year
Depreciation:
  < 1 yr  → 5%
  < 2 yr  → 15%
  < 3 yr  → 20%
  < 4 yr  → 30%
  < 5 yr  → 40%
  ≥ 5 yr  → 50%

IDV = Listed Price × (1 - Depreciation)
Annual Premium = IDV × 2%
High Mileage Surcharge (> 15,000 km/yr) = +20%
```

**Home IDV:**
```
Age = Current Year - Year Built
Depreciation:
  < 5 yr  → 0%
  < 10 yr → 10%
  < 20 yr → 20%
  < 30 yr → 30%
  ≥ 30 yr → 40%

IDV = Property Value × (1 - Depreciation)
Annual Premium = IDV × 0.1%
Security System Discount = -10%
```

---

## 10. Deployment (Local)

```
Docker Desktop (RabbitMQ container)
    +
SQL Server (local, Windows Auth)
    +
5 × dotnet run (Identity, Policy, Claims, Admin, Gateway)
    +
npx ng serve (Frontend)
```

All managed via `start-all.ps1` / `stop-all.ps1` scripts.
